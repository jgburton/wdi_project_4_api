#WDI PROJECT 4
This is my final project for the Web Development Immersive boot camp at General Assembly. This was a duo project.

#GA WDI Project 4

##Remote Composer - Duo Project Full-Stack App

A group project inspired by Stack Overflow, incorporating a charity element. Users can sign up choosing a charity via the integrated JustGiving API and ask programming questions. Other users can post answers in response to the question and the poster of the question then donates the set bounty to their answerers chosen charity.

###Technology

It was built using an Express/Node Backend accessing a MongoDB, with Angular on the Frontend. I was responsible for building out the Angular JS on the front end, including authentication and building the user index and user profile pages. We integrated the JustGiving API for selecting charities.

###Approach to the build of Code Fund: 

The app was built over the course of 4 days with a team of 5, this consisted of planning, collaboration and delegation of tasks. We used Balsamiq for wireframes, Trello for organisation and the delegation of tasks and git for version and collaboration control.
We also often pair programmed on more complicated tasks and brainstormed as a team for branding/design ideas.

###The completed app is deployed on Heroku:

Will link to live application when deployed.

###Wins

<p>It was my first experience working in a team and on a full MEAN stack application.</p> 

<p>Working in a team proved very efficient but also provided a large learning curve in communication both in person and digitally via Slack and Trello.</p> 

<p>Also a first working with Angular JS, I was very enthusiastic about learning a new JavaScript framework. It was a fairly simple way of learning about two-way data binding and provided an alternative method of implementing the front end authentication for users.</p> 


###Future Improvements: 

Currently a user can select a charity, however, there isn't an actual payment method involved. As an improvement it would be essential to implement a payment method using PayPal linking it to the charities.
